# Products we are working on

## Gathering data for estimating the real number of infected people
A product is under development to provide data to test the hypothesis. Please refer to our Slack channel #corona_poll

## Predicting the outbreak using standard models
SIR/SEIR models are used to simulate virus outbreaks. We are building a product to estimate their parameters based on different data sources and use them for long term predictions.
