# Products we are working on

## Gathering data for estimating the real number of infected people
A product is under development to provide data to test the hypothesis. Please refer to our Slack channel #corona_poll

## Predicting the outbreak using standard models
SIR/SEIR models are used to simulate virus outbreaks. We are building a product to estimate their parameters based on different data sources and use them for long term predictions. Please refer to our Slack channel #epidemic-model

## Monitoring system for breathing sounds
We aim to use mobile devices and a telephone chat bot to record breathing sounds in order to identify change points in these sounds. A change may indicate a worsening of an infected person health condition and can trigger different treatment. The monitoring system can be used in hospitals and from home. Please refer to our Slack channel #breathing-sounds
