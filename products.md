# Products we are working on

## Gathering data for estimating the real number of infected people
A product is under development to provide data to test the hypothesis. Please refer to our Slack channel #corona_poll

## Predicting the outbreak using standard models
SIR/SEIR models are used to simulate virus outbreaks. We are building a product to estimate their parameters based on different data sources and use them for long term predictions. Please refer to our Slack channel #epidemic-model

## Monitoring system for breathing sounds
We aim to use mobile devices and a telephone chat bot to record breathing sounds in order to identify change points in these sounds. A change may indicate a worsening of an infected person health condition and can trigger different treatment. The monitoring system can be used in hospitals and from home. Please refer to our Slack channel #breathing-sounds

## Public Task Board
Experts need to guide our fight against the virus with focus and efficiently. The task board will give direction to our efforts to fight the virus. A community of experts will post tasks and open problems and will advise on the solutions that are being generated by the community of contributors.
Essentially it's the entwining of two communities to achieve the same goal, aid in a rapid emergency response from the tech community through the guidance of those who have the experience. The task board will serve as a lightweight coordination mechanism.
