1- Do we have daily basis updated historical data sets? They can be city, state or country based aggregated numbers.
Probably most important ones can be total number of infected, death, recovered people count, number of tests done etc.
Any information is welcomed.
2- Static data like census data, hospital counts, bed counts, doctor counts, gender counts, age groups in cities,
states or countries etc.
3- Dates when governments make serious public announcements like quarantine, social distancing etc. I am talking about
big announcements not daily talks. A good example is Merkel did 2 weeks ago. This information is valuable to detect
change points in time series.
4- All the information above with geospatial information if available.
5- Do we have a centric database to store the data or just csv files? Or even a dfs which is updated regularly?
