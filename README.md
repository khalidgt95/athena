# Project Athena

At project Athena, volunteers join forces to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We deliver actionable insights from highly focused and joint research and data analysis efforts. 

Instead of plenty of individuals doing similar work over and over again, we create a platform to share data and knowledge. A cross-functional committee continuously derives new hypothesis from the collected knowledge. Single contributors and teams can choose to work on the hypothesis and publish their results. 

This website is our main tool to provide access to the project and to document and disseminate our results, insights and products.
### Our vision

United, we defeat the SARS-CoV-2 virus

### Our mission

We bring as many people as possible together to provide facts to the public and to support decision making on how to deal with the breakout in a highly coordinated and efficient way. Actionable insights may also lead to the fast development of products that help fight the virus.

### Our objectives

- By April 10th of 2020, we will have delivered on at least 5 [testable hypothesis](kick-off.md)
- By April 25th of 2020, we will have developed one [minimum viable product](kick-off.md) to help fight the virus

### Our strategies

- We provide public access to high quality and daily updated data sets
- We publicly share sound and validated knowledge and co-operate with other initiatives as much as we can 
- We form a multi-disciplinary committee consisting of researchers and data professional that guides and coordinates research and infrastructure work
- We formulate hypothesis that multiple individuals or teams can work on in parallel
- We provide maximum transparency on how we derive testable, scientific hypothesis. Tasks can be picked up to work on testing the hypothesis.
- We encourage anybody to submit new hypothesis and to contribute to the project
- We are constantly adjusting our processes to foster the highest impact possible given our scarce resources as a non-profit project

### Required Actions

- By the 19th of March, we have the basic processes and tools in place to start the project
- By the 20th of March we start recruiting people to join the project
- By the 23th of March 2020, we provide at least five data sets to the public
- By the 25th of March 2020, we have recruited the committee, made up of at least five researchers from various disciplines and data professionals

### How to kick-off project Athena

Everybody willing to contribute, please join our Slack workspace via the invite:

https://join.slack.com/t/projectathenaco/shared_invite/zt-cuthlqb8-NVXrCnmROwCMS55mOcEgvA

Before you join, please stick to the following Slack usage guidelines:

1. We do not use Slack to store documents and data, Slack is our communication channel
2. If there is something that is bothering you about Slack or our tooling, please refer to the improvements channel or discuss matters in relevant channels.
3. We do not use Slack for documentation purposes, documentation is done on this website or other sites that we link.
4. The "announcements" Slack channel is for announcements only. Announcements are done by the Athena committee. Discussions happen in more specific channels. 
5. There are two general channels for you to get guidance and help:
    1. questions_and_answers for any kind of information based on your questions 
    2. improvements for suggestions and discussions around project Athena and how to improve it.
 

The [kick-off page](kick-off.md) summarizes what we will do to get started.
