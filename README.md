# Project Athena

At project Athena, volunteers join forces to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We deliver actionable insights from highly focused and joint research and data analysis efforts. 

Instead of plenty of individuals doing similar work over and over again, we create a platform to share data and knowledge. A cross-functional committee continously derives hypothesis from the collectd knowledge. Single contributors and teams can choose to work on the hypothesis and publish their results. 

### Vision

United, we defeat the SARS-CoV-2 virus

### Mission

We bring as many people as possible together to provide facts to the public and to support decision making on how to deal with the breakout in a highly coordinated and efficient way.

### Objectives

- By mid April 2020, we will have delivered on at least 5 testable hypothesis

### Strategies

- We provide public access to high quality and daily updated data sets
- We publicly share sound and validated knowledge 
- We form a multi-disciplinary committee that guides and coordinates research and infrastructure work
- We formulate hypothesis that multiple individuals or teams work on in parallel
- We provide maximum transparency on how we derive testable, scientific hypothesis
