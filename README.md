# Project Athena

At project Athena, volunteers join forces to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We deliver actionable insights from highly focused and joint research and data analysis efforts. 

Instead of plenty of individuals doing similar work over and over again, we create a platform to share data and knowledge. A cross-functional committee continously derives hypothesis from the collectd knowledge. Single contributors and teams can choose to work on the hypothesis and publish their results. 

### Our vision

United, we defeat the SARS-CoV-2 virus

### Our mission

We bring as many people as possible together to provide facts to the public and to support decision making on how to deal with the breakout in a highly coordinated and efficient way.

### Our objectives

- By the 10th of April 2020, we will have delivered on at least 5 testable hypothesis

### Our strategies

- We provide public access to high quality and daily updated data sets
- We publicly share sound and validated knowledge 
- We form a multi-disciplinary committee that guides and coordinates research and infrastructure work
- We formulate hypothesis that multiple individuals or teams work on in parallel
- We provide maximum transparency on how we derive testable, scientific hypothesis 

### Required Actions

- By the 16 of March we have the basic processes and tools in place to start the project
- By the 16th of March we start recruiting people to join teh project
- By the 20th of March 2020, we provide at least five data sets to the public
- By the 23th of March 2020, we have recruited the committee, made of at least five researchers and data professionals

### Workstreams and Bootstrapping Hypothesis

1. "What we observe"
    * **Observations and assumptions** 
    
        Based on publicly available data from affected countries on infected, death and recovered cases, the spread seems to follow an exponential growth path. 
        However differences between countries exist in growth factors, fatality, speed of recovery, ratios between various measurements, time lags, testing and many more. 
        
    * **Hypothesis**
    
        1. The virus is spreading at an exponential rate of 1.2 day to day.
        2. Mortality is non-homogenous across countries or regions, varies significantly between countries
  

2. "What we suspect"
    * **Observations and assumptions**
        
        Not everyone with a SARS-CoV-2 infection will feel ill. Some people may even contract the virus and not develop symptoms. When there are symptoms, theyâ€™re usually mild and tend to come on slowly. There are estimates taht 50% of cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) take an asymptomatic course. Therefore a lot of cases have gone unnoticed as wide-spread testing is not available.
        
    * **Hypothesis**
    
        1. The real number of infected people is 300% higher than officially reported numbers.
        

3. "What we need to know"
    * **Observations and assumptions**
    
        COVID-19 seems to cause more severe symptoms in older adults and people with underlying health conditions, such as chronic heart or lung conditions. In some countries the age distribution of infected people does represent the general age distribution with the region or country.
        In Italy, a country with a rather old population, a analysis found that of the 105 patients at that time who died from the virus, the average age was 81 years. This puts a 20-year gap between the average age of people who tested positive for the virus and the deceased.

    * **Hypothesis**
    
        1. Mortality adjusted by age and country is below 1%

### Lightweigt processes required

- The committee needs to review and verify the work done on hypothesis. 
- Individuals and teams need to compete on working on hypothesis and need to report their findings and work in a public forum.
- The committee needs to decide on new hypothesis by accepting proposals and deciding upon them
- The committee needs to promote and publish the findings
