# Hypothesis we are working on

1. "Preventive measures taken by countries (regions, states) are an important driver and reduce the spread of the virus significantly" - Slack channel #hypo_preventive
2. "We can forecast the amount of infected people on a global level, a country level and a regional level up to 5 days in advance with an mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 5" - Slack channel #hypo_predict_short
3. "The real number of infected people is at least 300% higher than officially reported numbers." - Slack channel #estimate_spread. A product is under development to provide data to test the hypothesis at #corona_poll
