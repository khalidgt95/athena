# On-boarding information and plan

Project Athena has a very simple structure. The Athena committtee coordinates all our efforts and guides them. The committee manages information flows and establishes communication. 

The committee does not give instruction what to do. **Athena relies on lateral leadership exercised by everybody**. Everybody joining needs to actively engage and needs to be willing to lead initiatives on various levels.

## How can that be achieved?

1. We work on testing hypothesis that help fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
2. We discuss and develop hypothesis in the Slack channel #postulatehypothesis
3. Once we have a hypothesis identified, we ask one person to lead the hypothesis testing efforts and span a new Slack channel for it.
4. The hypothesis lead joins the Athena committee.
5. Hypothesis testing requires work to be done. The hypothesis lead encourages contributors to 
    1. join hands, 
    2. evaluates the feasibility of potential contributions, 
    3. identifies resources required to deliver it, 
    4. builds a work breakdown structure, 
    5. assigns tasks to individuals or teams based on skills and background
    6. and fosters collaboration to deliver the most feasible ideas within a week. 
    
    
**If you want to work on products that help to save lives, exchange the word "hypothesis" above with "product". To get started quickly, please join our Slack channels #postulatehypothesis or #product_ideas**

## Overview of our existing Slack channels

Slack will helps us to coordinate our joint actions. Before you start using the channels, please stick to the following usage guidelines:

1. We do not use Slack to store documents and data, Slack is our communication channel
2. If there is something that is bothering you about Slack or our tooling, please refer to the #improvements channel or discuss matters in other, relevant channels.
3. We do not use Slack for documentation purposes, documentation is done on our website

Our channels:

1. The #announcements channel is for announcements only. Announcements are done by the Athena committee. Discussions happen in more specific channels. 
2. There are two general channels for you to get guidance and help: #questions_and_answers for any kind of information based on your questions and #improvements for suggestions and discussions around project Athena and how to improve it.
Project Athena aims to focus efforts to provide actionable insights for SARS-CoV-2. A committee will be setup to steer our efforts. The committee will be overlooking and coordinating several continuous work-streams.
3. Information gathering - collect information on latest research on SARS-CoV-2, especially medical and epidemiological work - please refer to #information_gathering
4. Need identification - identify research and product development needs. We reach out to research communities or other groups and identify stakeholders who have a need that we can deliver upon - please refer to #need_identification
5. Postulate hypothesis - collect and decide upon hypothesis to evaluate - please refer to #postulatehypothesis
6. Data baseline - Provide access to high quality data so hypothesis can be tested - we collect data for use cases only! Please refer to #data_baseline
7. Review and publish - Review our research results and publish them for external feedback. Please refer to #review_and_publish
8. Supporting processes and tools - Communication and documentation infrastructure needs to be setup. How do we enable maximum autonomy for individuals and teams whilst keeping an overview of our initiatives. Please refer to #processes_and_tools
9. Athena committee - who will participate and how will the committee work, what is the cadence of meetings and which meetings will we need? Please refer to #athena_committee
10. Product ideas - we also aim to develop digital products to fight SARS-CoV-2 and discuss them. Please refer to #product_ideas
11. How do we get more people to join and contribute? #engage_more_people

**We have established several specific channels for hypothesis already, please refer to our [hypothesis page](working-hypothesis.md)!**
